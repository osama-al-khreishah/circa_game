# ðŸ§  Dev Mind Speed Game API  
*A Backend Task Submission for Circa*

Welcome to **Dev Mind Speed**, a high-speed mental math game built entirely as a **backend API**. Players solve dynamically generated math questions via **API requests** using tools like **Postman** or **Swagger UI**, with the system tracking accuracy and response times â€” no frontend needed.
